# Database Enhancement

For this enhancement that artifact that I chose is an inventory management application that can add item in an dynamic array and display the items in the array. This project was created in 2019 for my Object Oriented Programming with C++ class. 

The reason that I included this artifact in my ePortafolio is because it would be a great project to showcase my database skill because of the nature of the project. The project is a inventory management application which by using a database instead of a local dynamic array it further enhances its functionality and makes more complete. I improved the artifact by removing the use of a dynamic array and instead connected it to a local MySQL database, while adding the ability to add, update, delete, and display the items in the database. This also means that all the items can be access again when the user exist the program compared to the original where everything was lost when the user closed the application. While working on the enhancement I was able to meet all the course outcomes that I had planned to meet in module one. I also learned a lot more about working with MySQL as well as how to connect to it using C++ and how to query the database. I did face many challenges while working on the enhancement. Most of them revolved around my knowledge of IDEs. I first tried to use VSCode to write the application but I was having a hard time configuring VSCode to find the MySQL C++ Connector files so that I could use them in my project. I then decided to switched to Code::Blocks, which made much easier  to add external dependencies to it my project.
