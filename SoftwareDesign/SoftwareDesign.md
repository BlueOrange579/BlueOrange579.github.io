# Software Design Enhancement

The artifact that was used for this enhancement is a inventory management console application where one can add, and delete items stored in a dynamic array. This is a project that I completed for my Object Oriented Programming with C++ class in 2019. 	

This particular artifact was chosen because of how bare boned it was and the potential it had to offer in that ability on add more features to it. A couple of the specific components of the artifact that I improved was the interface, and the code organization. These components showcase my ability to design and implement an interface for a desktop application, while also demonstrating my skill in organizing my code and making it more modular and scalable. The artifact was improved by using raylib and raygui libraries to add a graphical interface to make it more user friendly and to more appealing. 
With the enhancements made to the original artifact the outcome I had planned to meet were met. I created the enhancements with security in mind by adding validation checks throughout the code to ensure there isn’t any random actions. This enhancements also met the outcome of demonstrating my ability to use techniques and skills to implements solutions to computer problems. 
Through the process of implementing the enhancements I was able to learn more about how to use raylib and raygui, how to better optimize and organize the code. There were many challenges that I faces when implementing this enhancements. One of them being the input boxes to enter the item’s information. Raygui offered a function to implement an input box but you could not use more than one in one window. To solve this issue I had to instead use core raylib to draw a rectangle and check collision to enter text into the rectangle. I also faced challenges in validating user input, such as ensuring that for price, the user only enter one period to represent cents and no more than one. I learned a lot of some of my weakness that I still need to work on and how to implement certain features that I might use for future programs.
