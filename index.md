# My Journey

The work that I have done throughout the program and working on my ePortfolio have been a big part in showcases my strengths and in which it will make me a valuable employee for hired. Through the program I was able to design and create module programs that will make is easy for collaboration in a team environment, and also working with a diverse number of people to solve problem helped in that aspect as well. There were many time I worked in a team through the program so I also learned how to properly communicate with people and deliver information in a way that suits the situation, such as communicating with stakeholders or fellow team members. As I moved up in the program I learned more about data structures and algorithms, such as which algorithms or data structure to use depending of the efficiency or what one is trying to achieve. In one of my classes about AI I applied a Q-learning algorithm to an agent in order to reach the end of a maze as fast and efficient as possible. I also learned how to implement a database and manipulate its data. Using MongoDB and Python I implemented an animal shelter database to store the information of pets and manipulating it by implementing CRUD functions using Python. Security was an important part of the program. I have gained knowledge in how to implement RESTful API to ensure that communications between the client and the server are secure. I put this in practice by creating an website that would implement RESTful API to secure the connection in one of my classes. 

	To Further showcase my skills I have worked in enhancing a project I completed a few years back by updating its design, using a different data structure, and also implementing a database. The original artifact that I used is a item inventory management console program using C++ in which a users could add and display the items. On one of the version of the enhance artifact I updated its design by taking a OOP approach and having separate files while also creating an GUI for easy navigation using Raylib. The next version I updated the data structure in use, instead of a dynamic array that I originally used, I replaced it with a map and also implemented more functionality such as edit and delete. In the last version, I enhanced it by implementing a database using MySQL.
